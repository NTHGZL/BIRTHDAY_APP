Project carried out as part of my studies at My Digital School Nantes.

Inspired by : https://www.florin-pop.com/blog/2019/05/countdown-built-with-react/.

## Get started

1 - Go to app/src/App.js and edit the Countdown Component with your birthday.

2 - Run : 
```bash
$ - docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d --build
```
3 - Enjoy
